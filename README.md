## Abstract

This study investigates the real-world efficacy of tailored pain management methods, focusing on Virtual Reality (VR) distraction therapy — a technique utilising immersive VR experiences to divert attention from pain. Participants undergo two phases consisting of VR therapy with simultaneous physiological data collection and the delivering of a conditioning stimulus via a smartwatch. Utilising machine learning, the VR experience is able to adapt to emotional states, ensuring that an individual’s focus is shifted away from pain. Results reveal an overall 42% pain reduction, offering insights into diverse pain interventions.
